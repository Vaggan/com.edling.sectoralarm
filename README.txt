Sector Alarm has changed its API and this makes this app no longer work.
I have been in contact with them to see if a solution can be found but it does not look bright.

With this app you can turn your alarm on and off (including partial protection) using flows.
It is also possible to trigger other flows when the alarm is switched on or off.

Instructions:
1. Settings
  a. Please enter the login information for My Pages and alarm code.
  b. SiteId does not need to be filled in, that field is set automatically at the first login.
2. Then add your alarm as a device.
